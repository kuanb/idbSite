                    <h3>An Introduction to the Northern Development Corridor</h3>
                    <p>Haiti’s Northern Corridor stretches some 70 km between the city of Cap Haïtien and the Dominican Republic border city of Ouanaminthe and hosts a population of some 600,000 people along Route Nationale 6 (RN6). Beyond the jobs directly created by the development of the Caracol Industrial Park (PIC) for which 20,000 to 40,000 jobs are projected, Haiti's Northern Corridor will see a rapid and significant growth in urbanization and demography. In the context of developing the PIC, which is located in the north-east of Haiti, the IDB wants to achieve a Regional Transportation Plan to guide the sustainable development of this major employment centre.</p>

                    <h3>Project Mandate</h3>
                    <p>The mandate is to develop a comprehensive portrait of regional mobility of goods and people in the Northern Corridor, identify strengths and weaknesses of the study area, assess the future demand for travel related to the development of the PIC and other urban development projects in the study area, and to propose measures to facilitate residential and industrial development within the context of sustainable development.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <i><p>The ultimate goals of the mandate are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>define the principles that will guide the desired mobility in the study corridor;</li>
                            <li>translate these principles into concrete projects; and</li>
                            <li>develop and detail three (3) of the proposed projects in the form of preliminary project notes (pre-investment).</li>

                    <h3>Planning for Growth</h3>
                        <p>To help Haitian communities address the challenges of Growth, ESCI has partnered with Haiti’s Interministerial Committee for Territorial Management and the Ministry of Economy and Finance.</p>
                    <h3>Joint Objectives</h3>
                        <p>• Mitigate short-term impacts while ensuring future sustainable growth.</p>
                        <p>• Generate and analyze previously unavailable data and information.</p>
                        <p>• Achieve the highest level of specificity in both diagnostic and future planning work.</p>
                        <p>• Translate a regional vision into site-specific and interdisciplinary plans for the communes closest to the PIC.</p>
                    <h3>New Growth Dynamics</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the Caracol Industrial Park, other anchor projects are currently being developed in the region: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tourism</li>
                                <li>Seaport Infrastructure</li>
                                <li>Henri Cristophe University</li>
                                <li>New Housing Projects</li>
                                <li>Agriculture and Irrigation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Urban Challenges and Needs</h3>
                        <p>Unplanned, rapid growth can increase conditions of informality as well as deteriorate community, landscape, and ecological conditions.</p>
